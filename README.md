## Installation

In addition to downloading the repo, you will need to either host this somewhere or spin up a local web server to run this app. The easiest way to do that is to open the project in VSCode and run the `index.html` file using the `Live Server` extension.

This is due to the use of `fetch` to retrieve the questions from a JSON file stored within the project.
